v1.0.0.beta.13
  -- files created during the extraction of xmp metadata are removed upon
	completion

v1.0.0.beta.12
  -- bug fix: now, updating the original will also regenerate the staticly defined variations

v1.0.0.beta.11
  -- bug fix: you can now update the original image by simply calling "load_original" or "load_original_from_file" again

v1.0.0.beta.9
  -- fixing bugs in accessing the original via `document.original` and `document.variations["original.jpg"]`

v1.0.0.beta.8
  -- new variation metadata methods:
    - "variation_name": retrieve a variation's name via the "variation_name" method. e.g.: document.variations[:thumbnail].variation_name #==> "thumbnail"
    - "variation_filename": retrieve a variation's filename via the "variation_filename" method. e.g.: document.variations[:thumbnail].variation_filename #==> "thumbnail.jpg"
